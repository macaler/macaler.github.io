      Hello! My name is Michelle. (Pronouns: she/her/hers) I am a former physics instructor <br>      
      who is looking to transition into data science and data analytics. When I am not delving <br>
      into data sets, I can be found cooking, knitting, or reading. I am also a lapsed runner <br>
      who is slowly trying to get back into the habit.

     This page is actively under construction. Thanks for coming by!

   I am committed to learning and practicing new skills. My coding languages include:
   <br>
   <ul style="PADDING-LEFT: 12px">
     <li>Python 3.8</li>
      I am familiar with these Python packages:
     <ul style="PADDING-LEFT: 15px">
      <li>Pandas</li>
      <li>NumPy</li>
      <li>SciPy</li>
      <li>Matplotlib</li>
      <li>Seaborn</i>
      <li>Scikit-Learn</li>
      <li>Re</li>
      <li>NLTK</li>
      <li>TensorFlow with Keras </li>
      <li>plot.ly</li>
     </ul>
     <br>
     <li>IDL (the Interactive Data Language) </li>
     <br>    
     <li>SQL</li>
     <br>
     <li>basic HTML</li>
   </ul>
   </section>
   In addition to these, I have very basic familiary with C++ and did a little bit of FORTRAN 90 coding about 15 or so years ago. <br>
   <br>
   I have used both Ubuntu and Windows for coding and have basic familiarity with the command line. I am comfortable working both in Jupyter Notebook and in the Python IDLE. <br>
   <br>
   As a physics instructor, I used Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel, and Microsoft PowerPoint regularly to create course materials and track student progress. Beyond this, I have basic familiarity with Excel pivot tables, vlookup tables, and dashboards.

   Every time I finish a project, I try to get it up on GitHub as soon as possible. 
   Many of these projects are Codecademy Pro guided projects which I completed as part of Codecademy skill paths or career paths.
   Some are directly inspired by skills I learned through Codecademy that I wanted to get additional practice with; 
   others result from seeing what I could do with datasets downloaded from Kaggle. <br>
   <br>
   Feel free to browse my GitHub repositories to see what all I have done! But here are some highlighted projects that I think show off a variety of my current skills.
